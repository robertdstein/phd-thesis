LSST

Ligo O4 + LIGO India + Kagra -> Many kilonovae -> Hubble constant, test general relativity, 

IceCube Gen2 + PeV band + KM3net + Baikal + P-One

IceCube upgrade -> Better systematics. Low-energy transients

Amanda discovered atmo flux, icecube astro flux, only hints/3$\sigma$ sources. Gen2 - $5\sigma$ sources.

Move from source searches to population studies, tomography, spectroscopy.

Gen2 sensitivity plot?

Ultrasat -> UV photon science

CTA

eROSITA

Automation + ML -> Probabilistic classification for stacking
Realtime all the time
