\begin{fquote}[Henri Poincare][Lady Windermere's Fan][18??] Without interpolation all science would be impossible.

\begin{fquote}[Feynman][Lady Windermere's Fan][18??] In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practise, there is.
\end{fquote}
\begin{fquote}[Douglas Adams][The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy][18??] A neutrino is not a big thing to be hit by. In fact it's hard to think of anything much smaller by which one could reasonably hope to be hit. And it's not as if being hit by neutrinos was in itself a particularly unusual event for something the size of the Earth. Far from it. It would be an unusual nanosecond in which the Earth was not hit by several billion passing neutrinos.
