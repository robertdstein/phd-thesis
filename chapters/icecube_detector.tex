\chapter{The IceCube Detector}
\labch{options}

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is the world's largest neutrino telescope, located at the geographic south pole. It was built as a successor to the AMANDA experiment, which had pioneered the detection of neutrinos in ice. AMANDA served as a proof of concept for the detection of neutrinos, but with a volume of just nkm$^{3}$, it only had sufficient effective area to measure atmospheric neutrinos. 

IceCube, on the other hand, was envisioned as a much larger detector capable of measuring astrophysical neutrinos. It was constructed in phases from 2006 to 2011, eventually reaching a total volume of one cubic kilometer.
